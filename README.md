# Visualizing Second Order Tensor Fields
This tool computes the bi-linear interpolation of tensor component from four input tensors (either from data or input symbolically).
The eigenvector field is then drawn along with separatrices overlayed.

## Libraries Used
To run this code you must have OpenGL, specifically the GLUT toolkit: https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/

## Symbollic Tensor Input

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


## Numerical Input

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
